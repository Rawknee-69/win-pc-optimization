# WinAeroTweaker Optimizations

This guide will help you optimize your Windows PC using the WinAeroTweaker tool, with configurations tailored for both high-end and low-end PCs. The instructions below are intended for Windows 10 and above.

## Steps for Optimization

### 1. **Download and Extract WinAeroTweaker**

- Download the `winaerotweaker.zip` file.
- Extract the contents to a folder on your PC.
- Run the installer to install the software.

### 2. **Import Configuration Files**

- After installation, open the WinAeroTweaker software.
- Import the appropriate configuration file:
  - For **high-end PCs**, use the `high-end-pc.ini` configuration.
  - For **low-end PCs**, use the `low-end-pc.ini` configuration.

  **Note:**  
  - The **low-end-pc.ini** provides more optimizations, but is recommended only if you're running an older PC with limited resources.  
  - The **high-end-pc.ini** is tailored for modern, high-performance PCs. It provides optimizations that focus on performance without compromising the user experience.

## Important Notes

- These optimizations are designed for **Windows 10** and higher.
- Always back up your system before applying any optimizations, as some settings may affect system behavior.
- Low end pc optimization turns off some security and windows updates and onedrive so if you guys use those just manually turn these settings off
