# WinAeroTweaker Optimizations

This guide will help you optimize your Windows PC using the **WinAeroTweaker** tool, along with additional batch file options for more comprehensive optimizations, including a recovery option.

The instructions below are intended for **Windows 10 and above**.

## Steps for Optimization

### 1. **Download and Extract WinAeroTweaker**

- Download the `winaerotweaker.zip` file.
- Extract the contents to a folder on your PC.
- Run the installer to install the software.

### 2. **Import Configuration Files**

- After installation, open the **WinAeroTweaker** software.
- Import the appropriate configuration file:
  - For **high-end PCs**, use the `high-end-pc.ini` configuration.
  - For **low-end PCs**, use the `low-end-pc.ini` configuration.

  **Note:**  
  - The **low-end-pc.ini** configuration provides more optimizations but is recommended only for older PCs with limited resources.  
  - The **high-end-pc.ini** configuration is tailored for modern, high-performance PCs and aims to improve performance without compromising user experience.

### 3. **Apply the Settings**

- Once you've imported the configuration, click the **Apply** button to save the changes.
- Restart your PC to ensure all optimizations take effect.

### 4. **Experience Improvements**

- After rebooting, you should notice significant performance improvements, especially in speed and resource usage.

## Batch File for System Optimization

In addition to using **WinAeroTweaker**, a batch file has been created to help you **disable startup apps**, **clear temp files**, and **defragment** the C: drive. It also provides a **recovery option** to revert changes if necessary.

### Available Options in the Batch File

1. **Recovery Option (Option 1)**: Reverts all settings to their previous state by restoring backups of startup apps and services.
2. **Basic Optimization (Option 2)**: Disables unnecessary startup apps and services, clears temp files, and runs defragmentation on the C: drive.
3. **Advanced Optimization (Option 3)**: Includes all actions from **Basic Optimization**, but with additional unnecessary services being disabled for more aggressive performance improvement.


## Important Notes

- These optimizations are designed for **Windows 10** and higher.
- Always **back up your system** before applying any optimizations, as some settings may affect system behavior.
- Low-end PC optimizations turn off certain services like security features, Windows updates, and OneDrive. If you use these features, be sure to manually turn them back on after applying the optimizations.
